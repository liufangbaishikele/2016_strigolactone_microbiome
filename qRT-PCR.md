Select genes as target for build over-expression construct

* Collect information and download sequence of genes involved in strigolactone biosynthesis and signaling. TAIR for Arabidopsis thaliana, and corresponding orthologs in Glycine max are infered.
* Download mRNA sequence for all strigolactone biosynthesis and signaling genes from SoyBase.
* Design primers for qRT-PCR use Primer3 based on multi-alignment results.
  1. Primer length 21-23bp
  2. At least three G/C at the last 5 bp at the 3' end of the designed primer
  3. Melting temperature 59-62 celsius.
